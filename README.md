Nusphere-PhpED-Dark-Theme
=========================

Nusphere PhpED Dark Theme


After you have downloaded the file you will need to replace your hl.cfg.

In Windows 7 or Vista this should be located in or around:

C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\[Roaming / Local]\NuSphere\PhpED\config

Likewise in XP it should be located in something like:
C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR_USER_NAME\Application Data\NuSphere\PhpED\config
The final step is to simply change your background color to a dark color. The background color is oddly saved in a different configuration file than the highlighting. This can be found in Tools ⇒ Settings ⇒ Editor ⇒ Appearance
